  Given the source segment and machine translation, identify error types in the translation and classify them.
  The error types are:
  - Accuracy:
    * Addition: The translation includes information not present in the source.
    * Mistranslation: The translation does not accurately represent the source.
    * Omission: The translation is missing content from the source.
    * Untranslated text: Text is left untranslated.
  - Fluency:
    * Character encoding: There are garbled characters or mojibake.
    * Grammar: There are issues with grammar.
    * Inconsistency: The translation is inconsistent in style, terminology, or otherwise.
    * Punctuation: There are issues with punctuation.
    * Register: The language is of an inappropriate register.
    * Spelling: There are misspellings.
  - Style: The translation style is not appropriate.
  - Terminology: The translation has terminology problems.
  - Other: Any other issues.
  - Non-translation: A non-translation issue, e.g., the source was corrupted.
  - No-error: No error found in this segment.

  Classify each error as one of:
  - Critical: Errors that render the translation completely wrong, misleading, or incomprehensible.
  - Major: Errors that impact comprehension but do not completely mislead or confuse the user.
  - Minor: Errors that do not impact comprehension.

  Calculate the MQM score as: 100 - (25 x Critical + 5 x Major + 1 x Minor).

  Here is one example:

  Example:
  English source: So we attach this by pressing Ctrl+J.
  Korean translation: 그래서 Ctrl+J를 눌러서 이걸 붙여주는 거죠.
  MQM annotations:
  Critical: 
  No-error
  Major: 
  Mistranslation: '붙여주는' (attaching) vs. '연결' (connecting)
  Minor: 
  Register: "거죠" is too informal compared to a more appropriate "합니다"
  MQM score: 94

  Now evaluate this translation:

  English source: {source_text}
  Korean translation: {translation}

  Identify and classify errors, then calculate the final MQM score.

  Calculate the MQM score as: 100 - (10 x Major + 2 x Minor).

  Here is one example:

  Q:
  English source: So we attach this by pressing Ctrl+J.
  Reference: Ctrl+J를 눌러서 이것을 연결합니다.
  Korean translation: 그래서 Ctrl+J를 눌러서 이걸 붙여주는 거죠.

  Based on the given source and reference, identify the major and minor errors in this
  translation. Note that Major errors refer to actual translation or grammatical errors, and
  Minor errors refer to smaller imperfections, and purely subjective opinions about the
  translation.

  A:
  Major errors:
  (1) "붙여주는" - Mistranslation
  Minor errors:
  (1) "이걸" and "거죠" - Register
  MQM score = 100 - (10 + 2) = 86

  Q:
  English source: {source_text}
  Korean translation: {translation}

  Based on the given source and reference, identify the major and minor errors in this
  translation. Note that Major errors refer to actual translation or grammatical errors, and
  Minor errors refer to smaller imperfections, and purely subjective opinions about the
